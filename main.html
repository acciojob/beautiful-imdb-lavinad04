		<p class="movieDetail">Fight Club is a 1999 American film directed by David Fincher and
			starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter. 
			It is based on the 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk. Norton plays 
			the unnamed narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar
			job. He forms a "fight club" with soap salesman Tyler Durden 
			(Pitt), and becomes embroiled in a relationship with an impoverished 
			but beguilingly attractive woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).

Palahniuk's novel was optioned by Fox 2000 Pictures producer Laura Ziskin,
			who hired Jim Uhls to write the film adaptation. Fincher was
			selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed
			the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the
			cast and others in the film industry. It was filmed in and around 
			Los Angeles from July to December 1998. He and the cast compared 
			the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967),
			with a theme of conflict between Generation X and the value system
			of advertising.</p>
